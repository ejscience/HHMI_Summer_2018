# HHMI_Summer_2018
Repository for my data during my time working as an HHMI EXROP student for Dr. Dan Bolnick. 

To run analysis all work was done using Bayesian Inference as taught in Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath. To run analysis in R you must follow the steps as outlined in his book and website ( https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/ ). 

Be sure to add the C++ compiler before adding the "rethinking" package
